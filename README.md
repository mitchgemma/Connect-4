# H1 Connect 4
## H2 Game Concept
Players will alternate taking turns and placing a game piece. Each player will be assigned a color. Game pieces will fall to the bottom of the game board and stack on top of each other. The objective is to get 4 of your own colors in a row, while defending against your opponent so they do not get 4 in a row.
