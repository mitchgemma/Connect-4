# Connect 4
## Game Concept
Players will alternate taking turns and placing a game piece. Each player will be assigned a color. Game pieces will fall to the bottom of the game board and stack on top of each other. The objective is to get 4 of your own colors in a row, while defending against your opponent so they do not get 4 in a row.
 
 
### Game Requirements:
- Start screen should have instructions and start button
- User should be able to click a column to place a game piece
- Turns should alternate between 2 colors
- Pieces should stack on top of each other
- Game should have a reset button
- Message should be displayed on whoâ€™s turn it is
- Game should detect when there are 4 of the same colors in a row - once a win is detected, create message that says the winner
- Once win is detected, game board should be frozen and button should be created to start game over
- Tying combinations should be able to be detected

### Stretch Goals:
- Create a score tracker. After each game add a tally to the scoreboard for the winning team, if users want to play several games
- Highlight winning combination on the gameboard
- Changes to page before, during, and after the game
- Animate the ship going down the column
- Play against computer or against someone else
